## Project STARfox
**S**moke **T**est **A**utomation **R**epository for Fire*fox* Desktop

A Python Selenium based set of tests for smoke testing of Firefox, including Fx incident smoke testing.

### Build under test
Get the build to be smoke tested from the [candidates](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/candidates/) directory. Incident testing: Ask 
the RelMan contact for the current Incident what the build versions is. 

The test suite needs to know exactly where the build under test is located. 
Install the build in a Custom directory as follows per Platform:
- Windows:
  - Download the .exe: (as example) /pub/firefox/candidates/121.0.1-candidates/build1/win64/en-US/Firefox Setup 121.0.1.exe
  - Install in:"C:\Program Files\\**_Custom Firefox_**\\"
- macOS: 
  - Download the .dmg: (as example) /pub/firefox/candidates/121.0.1-candidates/build1/mac/en-US/Firefox 121.0.1.dmg
  - Install as: "/Applications/**_Custom Firefox.app_**/ (renamed from the default Firefox.app)
- Linux: 
  - Download the tar file: (as example) /pub/firefox/candidates/121.0.1-candidates/build1/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-121.0.1.tar.bz2
  - Install in: "/home/*user*/Desktop/**_Custom Firefox_**/" (*user* = your system username)

Launch the build manually one time to navigate through any system permission dialogs, then exit Firefox.

### Getting set up
- If you don't have Python 3.10 or higher installed install it. For most people,
  [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) will be a useful tool. If you don't want that, use your system's
  package manager or download and install it from the official website
  [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to check the option to add Python to
  the system PATH during installation. For Ubuntu, consider using the
  [Deadsnakes PPA](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) if your version's apt repo does
  not contain a version higher than 3.9.
- Install pip - run `python -m ensurepip`
  confirm: `pip --version`
- Download and install GeckoDriver: 
  - Get the latest version of [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) for your Platform.
  - Extract and install it, then ensure that directory is in your PATH
- Get the project from git:
  - On Linux:
    - run: `sudo apt install git`
  - On Windows:
    - run: `choco install git` (have to install chocolatey, if not present)
  - On MacOS:
    - run: `git --version` (likely already installed, follow install prompts if not)
  - In a location of your choice, run: `git clone https://github.com/mozilla/fx-desktop-qa-automation FxAutomation`
- Use pip to install Pipenv:
  - run: `pip install --user pipenv`. If prompted to add a directory to PATH, please do so. Windows
    users may need to restart their shell.
- Install dependencies: `pipenv install`
- Start virtual environment: `pipenv shell`
  - Ensure pynput is installed
    - run: `pip list` to see if it's in the list
      - if not, run: `python -m pip install pynput`
    - you still may run into problems when running the test suite later. 
      If pynput is not found, ensure the libraries are in your PATH.
- Ensure your system allows the following to run in the virtual env:
  - Firefox (specifically the build being tested)
  - Terminal

### Run the tests
- CD into the FxAutomation project directory
- run `./devsetup.sh`
- run: `pytest`
- IMPORTANT: On MacOS you may be prompted to allow Terminal to control accessibility settings.
  Allow this. You may need to re-run the tests.
- Test results are displayed inline.

- ### Notable command line options
- --run-headless (run the tests in headless mode)
- --fx-channel=option (options are Custom(default), Firefox, Nightly)
- --fx-executable=path (overrides `--fx-channel`, location of a Fx executable)
- --html=report.html (creates an html report file, report.html, in top project directory)

- On Failure:
  - rerun failed tests: `pytest --lf`
  - rerun the test suite as above - run: `pytest`
  - or just the failed test; i.e.: `pytest test_amazon.py`

### Documentation

We are trying documentation with [pdoc](https://pdoc.dev), run the following in a pipenv shell:

```bash
pdoc --docformat "numpy" modules
```

This should show you all the documentation pertaining to the helper functions and classes we've
created. If we make new ones, replace `modules` with the name of any other folder you would
like to have documentation on.

### IDE Pycharm Configuration
Note: you may need to install Rust for PyCharm to work properly.

#### Configuration to run tests from the IDE interactive interface
- Open Run/Debug Configurations**:
    - Click on the **Current File** in the toolbar and select **Edit Configurations**, or
    - Click on the **More actions** button (three dots) and select **Edit** from the configuration section
- Open Edit Configuration Templates**:
    - In the **Templates** section, select **Python tests** and then **pytest**
    - Set the **Working directory** to the path of your current project root directory
    - Ensure you have the correct Python interpreter selected
    - Leave all other settings as default
    - Click Apply

- #### Tabs and Indents config
- json:
    - Tab size: 4
    - Indent: 4
    - Continuation indent: 8
    - Keep indents on empty lines unchecked

### TestRail Reporting

Timer-based TestRail reporting is enabled for MacOS, Windows, and Linux OSes in appropriate testing
environments. In order to "manually" report to TestRail--that is, report on a run from the command line,
you need to do the following:

- Have a TestRail API key
- Set the following environment variables:
- - `TESTRAIL_REPORT`: `true` (or other true value)
- - `TESTRAIL_BASE_URL`: <location of TestRail instance>
- - `TESTRAIL_USERNAME`: what it sounds like
- - `TESTRAIL_API_KEY`: what it sounds like
- - `FX_EXECUTABLE`: actual location of the Firefox build under test

You should then be able to call `pytest --fx_executable $FX_EXECUTABLE` and have the results reported.
You may find that if you are re-running all previously executed test runs that you receive an error of
"Session is not reportable." If you wish to overwrite a previously reported session, add
`REPORTABLE=true` to your environment.

### Test Account Secrets Management (not fully implemented)
To protect our test logins to various services, we encrypt them with a key. This key is available from repo
maintainers if you ask. Please be careful with it. This key must exist in the environment as SVC_ACCT_DECRYPT
in order for encryption and decryption to work. To encrypt secrets, use the create_secrets.py script and
enter the secrets as JSON. Each type of account (e.g. GMail, Netflix) should have one file associated with it,
and all of the secrets exist as follows:

`data/secrets/examples` (after decryption):

```json
{
  "account_one": {
    "username": "bobs_account",
    "password": "MosteSecurePasseworde",
    "otp_url": "otpauth://totp/Mozilla:foxy@mozilla.com?secret=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&issuer=Mozilla"
  },

  "account_two": {
    "username": "janesAccount",
    "password": "N0N33d4Apassword",
    "recovery_email": "everyone@example.com"
  }
}
```

To decrypt in a test, request the `use_secrets` function factory fixture. Then, in a test, call e.g.
`login = use_secrets("examples", "account_two")` and Jane's Example service account will be in a dict
called `login`.

**DO NOT PUSH UNENCRYPTED SECRETS.**

**DO NOT ADD SECRETS UNNECESSARILY.**

    C1756769: Verify that the user can Download a PDF

    Notes:
        - Firefox is launched with a new profile that has default download settings.
        - This means the OS-level "Save File" dialog will appear for every download.
        - Selenium cannot interact with this native dialog directly, so the test
          must rely on fixed waits to give the OS time to render the dialog and to
          finish writing the file.
